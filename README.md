# Electronics

This repository contains electronics-related freelance, hobby etc. projects of mine.
I decided to publish from my archive or migrate them from another Github repository to here.
All of the projects published here will be very old as I am not currently working on Embedded Systems.
But I am reviewing and trying to reproduce outputs (not always possible since I don't have the setup) before publishing
them.

You can find here Schematic, PCB design, firmware mostly targeted for STM devices.
Consider every root folder as a project and the below sub-title as its description.
If you find anything useful, do not hesitate to get more information.

## Algorithmic Game Machine

This repository contains the first implementations I made to get the job of the Algorithmic Game Machine project.
This project was supposed to be a game machine helping children in learning algorithms.
The presentation was made in BTM Istanbul to find investors but did not succeed.
