# Electronics

This repository contains electronics-related projects (freelance, hobby ...) from my archive.

All of the projects are very old, simple, and not full implementations - just initial development or a POC.
I reviewed them and tried to reproduce outputs (not always possible due to setup requirements) before publishing them.

You can find here the Schematic, PCB design, and firmware mostly targeted for STM devices.
Consider every top folder as a project and the below sub-title as its description.
If you find anything useful, do not hesitate to get more information.
